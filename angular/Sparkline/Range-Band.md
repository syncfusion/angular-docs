## Range Band  

The range band feature is used to highlight a particular range along the y-axis using start and end range property. You can also customize the color and opacity of the range band. 

{% highlight ts %}

this.rangeBandSettings = {
    startRange: 4,
    endRange: 30,
    color: "#ff14ae",
    opacity: 0.4
};

{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight html %}

<ej-sparkline id="sparklinecontainer" [rangeBandSettings]="rangeBandSettings">          
                               
</ej-sparkline>
