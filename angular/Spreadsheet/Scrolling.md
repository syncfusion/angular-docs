# Scrolling

Scrolling helps you to move quickly to different areas of worksheet. Scrolling can be enabled by setting `allowScrolling` as true in `scrollSettings`. 

You can scroll through worksheet using one of the following ways,

* Using the arrow keys
* Using the scroll bars
* Using the mouse

## Set height and width for Scrolling

To set height and width in spreadsheet use `height` and `width` property in `scrollSettings`. The default value for `height` and `width` is `100%`. The height and width can be set in percentage and pixel. 

The following code example describes the above behavior.

{% highlight html %}
<ej-spreadsheet id="spreadsheet" [scrollSettings]="scrollSettings">
</ej-spreadsheet> 
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight ts %}

import {Component, ViewEncapsulation} from '@angular/core';
    @Component({
        selector: 'ej-app',
        templateUrl: 'app/app.component.html',  //give the path file for spreadsheet component html file.
    })
  export class AppComponent {
  public scrollSettings;
  constructor() {
      this.scrollSettings = { width: "50%", height: 400 , allowScrolling: true}; // Height in pixel and Width in percentage
 }
}
{% endhighlight %}

The following output is displayed as a result of the above code example.
