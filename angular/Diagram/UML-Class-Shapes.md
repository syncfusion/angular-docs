### UML Class Diagram Shapes

Class diagram is used to represent the static view of an application. The class diagrams are widely used in the modelling of object oriented systems because they are the only UML diagrams which can be mapped directly with object oriented languages. 
Diagram supports to generate the class diagram shapes from business logic. 

The UML class diagram shapes are explained as follows.

### Class

A Class describes a set of objects that shares the same specifications of features,constraints and semantics.To define a class object, you need to define the `classifier` as "class".
Also, you need to define the name, attributes and methods of the class using the `class` property of node.
 
The following code example illustrates how to create a class.

{% highlight html %}

<ej-diagram  id="diagramCore" width="700px" height="500px" [nodes]="nodes">
</ej-diagram>

{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight javascript %}
import { Component } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'ej-app',
  templateUrl: 'app/components/diagram/default.component.html'
})
export class ShapesComponent {
    nodes: Array<any>;
    constructor() {
        this.nodes = [
            {
                name: "Patient",
                offsetX: 100,
                offsetY: 100,
                borderWidth: 2,
                borderColor: "black",
                //Sets type of shape
                type: "umlclassifier",
                //Sets the type of classifier
                classifier: ej.datavisualization.Diagram.ClassifierShapes.Class,
                //Sets the class object
                "class": {
                    //Name of a class header
                    name: "Patient",
                    //Sets the collection of attributes
                    attributes: [{
                            name: "accepted",
                            type: "Date",
                            //sets the scope value for class member
                            scope: "protected"
                        },
                        {
                            name: "prescription",
                            type: "String[*]"
                        }
                    ],
                    //Sets the collection of methods
                    methods: [{
                        name: "getHistory",
                        //sets the arguments for methods
                        arguments: [{
                            name: "Date"
                        }],
                        type: "History"
                    }]
                },
            }
        ];
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

N> The default value for the property `classifier` is "class".

### Interface

An Interface is a kind of classifier that represents a declaration of a set of coherent public features and obligations. To create an interface, you need to define the `classifier` property as "interface". 
Also, you need to define the methods and members of the interface using the `interface` property of the node.

The following code example illustrates how to create an interface.

{% highlight javascript %}

export class ShapesComponent {
    nodes: Array<any>;
    constructor() {
        this.nodes = [
            {
                name: "Bank",
                offsetX: 100,
                offsetY: 100,
                borderWidth: 2,
                borderColor: "black",
                //Sets type of shape
                type: "umlclassifier",
                //Sets the type of classifier
                classifier: ej.datavisualization.Diagram.ClassifierShapes.Interface,
                //Sets the interface object
                interface: {
                    name: "Bank Account",
                        attributes: [{
                                name: "ownar",
                                type: "String[*]"
                            },
                            {
                                name: "balance",
                                type: "Dollars"
                            }
                        ],
                        methods: [{
                            name: "deposit",
                            arguments: [{
                                name: "amount",
                                type: "Dollars"
                            }],
                        }]
                    },
                }
            ];
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

###  Enumeration

To define an enumeration, you need to define the `classifier` property of node as "enumeration".  Also you need to define the name and members of the enumeration using the `enumeration` property of node. 

The following code example illustrates how to create an enumeration.
 
{% highlight javascript %}

export class ShapesComponent {
    nodes: Array<any>;
    constructor() {
        this.nodes = [
            {
                name: "Enums",
                offsetX: 100,
                offsetY: 100,
                borderWidth: 2,
                borderColor: "black",
                //Sets type of shape
                type: "umlclassifier",
                //Sets the type of classifier
                classifier: ej.datavisualization.Diagram.ClassifierShapes.Enumeration,
                //Sets the enumeration object
                enumeration: {
                    name: "AccountType",
                    //sets the members of enumeration
                    members: [{
                            name: "Checking Account"
                        },
                        {
                            name: "Savings Account"
                        },
                        {
                            name: "Credit Account"
                        }
                    ]
                }
            }
        ];
    }
} 

{% endhighlight %}

### Relationships

A relationship is a general term covering the specific types of logical connections found on class diagrams.

The list of relationships are demonstrated as follows.

| shape | Image |
|---|---|
| Association | ![](/angular/Diagram/Shapes_images/Shapes_img144.png) |
| Aggregation | ![](/angular/Diagram/Shapes_images/Shapes_img145.png) |
| Composition | ![](/angular/Diagram/Shapes_images/Shapes_img146.png) |
| Inheritance | ![](/angular/Diagram/Shapes_images/Shapes_img147.png) |
| Dependency  | ![](/angular/Diagram/Shapes_images/Shapes_img148.png) |

### Association

Association is basically a set of links that connects elements of an UML model. The type of association are as follows.

* Directional
* BiDirectional

The `association` property allows you to define the type of association. The default value of `association` is "Directional". The following code example illustrates how to create an association.

{% highlight html %}

<div>
    <ej-diagram  id="diagramCore" width="700px" height="500px" [connectors]="connectors">
    </ej-diagram>
</div>

{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight javascript %}

export class ShapesComponent {
    connectors: Array<any>;
    constructor() {
        this.connectors = [
            {
                name: "connect1",
                sourcePoint: {
                    x: 100,
                    y: 200
                },
                targetPoint: {
                    x: 300,
                    y: 200
                },
                segments: [{
                    type: "straight"
                }],
                shape: {
                    type: "umlclassifier",
                    //Sets the type of the relationships as association
                    relationship: ej.datavisualization.Diagram.ClassifierShapes.Association,
                    //Sets the type of association
                    association: ej.datavisualization.Diagram.AssociationFlows.Directional,
                }
            }];
    }
}

{% endhighlight %}

N> The default value for the property `association` is "directional".

### Aggregation

Aggregation is a binary association between a property and one or more composite objects which group together a set of instances.
Aggregation is decorated with a hollow diamond. To create an aggregation shape, you need to define the `relationship` as "aggregation".

The following code example illustrates how to create an aggregation.

{% highlight html %}

<ej-diagram width="100%" height="600"  [connectors]="connectors">
</ej-diagram>

{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight javascript %}

export class ShapesComponent {
    connectors: Array<any>;
    constructor() {
        this.connectors = [
            {
                name: "connect1",
                sourcePoint: {
                    x: 100,
                    y: 200
                },
                targetPoint: {
                    x: 300,
                    y: 200
                },
                segments: [{
                    type: "straight"
                }],
                shape: {
                    type: "umlclassifier",
                    //Sets the type of the relationships as aggregation
                    relationship: ej.datavisualization.Diagram.ClassifierShapes.Aggregation,
                }
            }];
    }
}

{% endhighlight %}

![](/angular/Diagram/Shapes_images/Shapes_img145.png)

### Composition

Composition is a "strong" form of "aggregation". Composition is decorated with a black diamond.
To create a composition shape, define the `relationship` property of connector as "composition".

The following code example illustrates how to create a composition.

{% highlight javascript %}

export class ShapesComponent {
    connectors: Array<any>;
    constructor() {
        this.connectors = [
            {
                name: "connect1",
                sourcePoint: {
                    x: 100,
                    y: 200
                },
                targetPoint: {
                    x: 300,
                    y: 200
                },
                segments: [{
                    type: "straight"
                }],
                shape: {
                    type: "umlclassifier",
                    //Sets the type of the relationships as composition
                    relationship: ej.datavisualization.Diagram.ClassifierShapes.Composition,    
                }
            }];
    }
}

{% endhighlight %}

![](/angular/Diagram/Shapes_images/Shapes_img146.png)

### Dependency

Dependency is a directed relationship which is used to show that some UML elements needs or depends on other model elements for specifications. Dependency  is shown as dashed line with opened arrow.
To create a dependency, you need to define the `relationship` property of connector as "dependency".

 The following code example illustrates how to create an dependency.

{% highlight javascript %}

export class ShapesComponent {
    connectors: Array<any>;
    constructor() {
        this.connectors = [
            {
                name: "connect1",
                sourcePoint: {
                    x: 100,
                    y: 200
                },
                targetPoint: {
                    x: 300,
                    y: 200
                },
                segments: [{
                    type: "straight"
                }],
                shape: {
                    type: "umlclassifier",
                    //Sets the type of the relationships as dependency
                    relationship: ej.datavisualization.Diagram.ClassifierShapes.Dependency,    
                }
            }];
    }
}

{% endhighlight %}

![](/angular/Diagram/Shapes_images/Shapes_img147.png)

### Inheritance

Inheritance is also called as "generalization". Inheritance is a binary taxonomic directed relationship between a more general classifier(super class) and a more specific classifier(subclass).
Inheritance is shown as a line with hollow triangle.

To create a inheritance, you need to define the `relationship` as "inheritance".

The following code example illustrates how to create an inheritance.

{% highlight javascript %}

export class ShapesComponent {
    connectors: Array<any>;
    constructor() {
        this.connectors = [
            {
                name: "connect1",
                sourcePoint: {
                    x: 100,
                    y: 200
                },
                targetPoint: {
                    x: 300,
                    y: 200
                },
                segments: [{
                    type: "straight"
                }],
                shape: {
                    type: "umlclassifier",
                    //Sets the type of the relationships as inheritance
                    relationship: ej.datavisualization.Diagram.ClassifierShapes.Inheritance,    
                }
            }];
    }
}

{% endhighlight %}

### Multiplicity

Multiplicity is a definition of an inclusive interval of non-negative integers to specify the allowable number of instances of described element. The type of multiplicity are as follows.

* OneToOne
* ManyToOne
* OneToMany
* ManyToMany

By default the multiplicity will be considered as "OneToOne". You can customize it using the `multiplicity` property of connector.

The following code example illustrates how to customize the multiplicity.

{% highlight javascript %}

export class ShapesComponent {
    connectors: Array<any>;
    constructor() {
        this.connectors = [
            {
                name: "connect1",
                sourcePoint: {
                    x: 100,
                    y: 200
                },
                targetPoint: {
                    x: 300,
                    y: 200
                },
                labels: [{
                    margin: {
                        top: 10,
                        left: 10,
                        right: 10,
                        bottom: 20
                    }
                }],
                segments: [{
                    type: "straight"
                }],
                shape: {
                    type: "umlclassifier",
                    relationship: ej.datavisualization.Diagram.ClassifierShapes.Dependency,
                    //Sets the type of multiplicity
                    multiplicity: {
                        //Sets the type of multiplicity
                        type: "onetomany",
                        //Sets the source label
                        source: {
                            //Sets the optionality/cardinality for the connector
                            optional: true,
                            //Specifies interval for number of instances of described element
                            lowerBounds: 89,
                            upperBounds: 67
                        },
                        //Sets the target label
                        target: {
                            optional: true,
                            lowerBounds: 78,
                            upperBounds: 90
                        }
                    }
                }
            }]
    }
}

{% endhighlight %}

### Editing

You can edit the name, attributes and methods of the class diagram shapes just with a double click. When you double click a class diagram shape, a text editor with three different sections(name, members, methods) will be generated.
The string "---" acts as a splitter between the three sections. 

The following image illustrates how the text editor will be.
