# TreeMapLevels

The levels of **TreeMap** can be categorized into two types as,

* FlatLevel
* Hierarchical Level

## Flat Level

### GroupPath

You can use `groupPath` property for every flat level of the **TreeMap** control. It is a path to a field on the source object that serves as the **“Group”** for the level specified. You can group the data based on the `groupPath` in the **TreeMap** control. When the `groupPath` is not specified, then the items are not grouped and the data is displayed in the order specified in the `dataSource`.

### GroupGap

You can use `groupGap` property to separate the items from every flat level and to differentiate the levels mentioned in the **TreeMap** control.
