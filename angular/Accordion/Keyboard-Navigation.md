# Keyboard Navigation

You can use **Keyboard** shortcut keys as an alternative to the mouse in Accordion widget using [allowKeyboardNavigation](https://help.syncfusion.com/api/js/ejaccordion#members:enablepersistence) property. However, you will have to focus the control to enable the keyboard navigation. Accordion Widget allows you to perform all kind of actions using keyboard shortcuts.
