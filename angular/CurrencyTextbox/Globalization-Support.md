# Globalization Support

**Globalization** is language support based on the culture in CurrencyTextBox. You can achieve the **Globalization** using “**locale”** property in CurrencyTextBox. 

The CurrencyTextBox widget provides multi-language support using globalization. You can customize the CurrencyTextBox with your own language style by using this feature. You can change the globalization by using the **locale** property. The default value for **locale** property is **en-US** in CurrencyTextBox controls. Also you can specify the [currencySymbol](https://help.syncfusion.com/api/angular/ejtextboxes#members:currencysymbol) property when the user wants to overwrite the currency symbol commonly instead of the current culture symbol. More than 350 culture specific files are available to localize the value.
 
 N> All the culture-specific script files are available within the below specified location, once you have installed Essential Studio in your machine, therefore it is not necessary to download these files explicitly.

<table>
<tr>
<td>

    '(installed location)\Syncfusion\Essential Studio\{{ site.releaseversion }}\JavaScript\assets\scripts\i18n'
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

    For example, If you have installed the Essential Studio package within C:\Program Files (x86), then navigate to the below location, 
    C:\Program Files (x86)\Syncfusion\Essential Studio\{{ site.releaseversion }}\JavaScript\assets\scripts\i18n

</td></tr>
</table>

Refer the below German culture file in head section of HTML page after the reference of **ej.web.all.min.js** file.

 {% highlight javascript %}
   
           <script src="http://cdn.syncfusion.com/{{ site.releaseversion }}/js/i18n/ej.culture.de-DE.min.js"></script>
                
 {% endhighlight %}

You can dynamically change the language based on their culture.

## Configure Globalization

The following example describes the way to use localization for **CurrencyTextBox** widgets.

{% highlight html %}

<input id="currency" type="text" ej-currencytextbox [value]="value" [locale]="locale" [decimalPlaces]="decimalPlaces"/>

{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight html %}

import { Component } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
    selector: 'ej-app',
    templateUrl: 'src/currencytextbox/currencytextbox.component.html'
})
export class CurrencyTextboxComponent {
    public value: number;
    public locale: string;
    public decimalPlaces: number;
    constructor() {
        this.value = 33;
        this.locale = "de-DE";
        this.decimalPlaces = 2;
    }
}

{% endhighlight %}
